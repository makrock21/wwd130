      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a graphic designer. I am constantly working on various projects both big and small. I
        would love it if there was a platform I could create to show off this work in a clean and well
        designed way. Not only does this allow me to show off my various types of commissions
        and ideas I’ve done but also be able to advocate for myself in an artistic way that is all my
        own.
        There are various templates online that are used to easily make a portfolio. However with
        this website it will be all my own which would then be a strong selling point to show off
        that not only can I have work to show but have it be on my own personal platform. I ask
        you, that when you look to hire somebody wouldn’t you like their portfolio to 100% reflect
        who they are as an artist both with the website and the content within? That is my plan
        going forward with this design and website. Thank you!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>For my audience it will be towards anyone wanting to know more about me and what I do for a living. Specifically, I want to be able to generate future employment through this site. In order to do that I need my audience to be potential employers. The gender will be neutral and the age range can be 18 years or older. This is specific toward people that need or want graphic design, photography, and/or UI design work done.</p>  <!-- change this -->
